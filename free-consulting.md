Hello,

I'm [Marc][1], the VP of Engineering Europe at Getaround, the leading car sharing company. You might also know us as Drivy, as Getaround acquired the project last year. I've also been doing some technical and organisational consulting work for the past 7 years, helping startups and more established companies getting over roadblocks.

As part of an experiment I've decided to make myself available **for free** to startups tackling topics positively impacting society, including but not limited to:

- Climate change
- Healthcare access
- Homelessness
- Human rights
- Access to water
- Access to education for underprivileged

## What I can do for you

### Topics

I can usually help you on most aspects of building a web product. We can either focus on the big picture or discuss a point of detail, but generally people are interested in:

- Organizing product & engineering team to improve delivery. 
- Getting over a technical roadblock. On this I'll be more relevant if you're in the web space, and even more if you're doing Ruby development.
- Getting better at sourcing, interviewing, hiring, onboarding and retaining people.
- Handling the issues that come with scale, be it technical or organisational.
- Improving the relationship between business & engineering and finding the right balance between controling technical debt and moving fast.
- Evaluating technical choices.
- Adopting better managerial practices.

### Format

To make progress on your particular situation, I can:
- Be there to bounce ideas together, brainstorm whatever you have in mind. It's always interesting to have an external point of view on what you are trying to do
- Challenge your existing situation or audit a possible change.
- Share what I've learned from previous experiences: what worked, what didn't.
- Review some code, PRDs, architectural choices...
- Be a neutral third party to help facilitate hard discussions or complicated organisational decisions.

... but really there is no fixed format besides an open discussion between us.

### Reviews

Here are a couple of reviews from people I've had the chance to work with:

**Gilles Bertaux** (Cofounder & CEO [Livestorm][2]): “As first-time founders, there was a ‘before’ and an ‘after’ Marc. He helped us accelerate on different aspects of building a tech product: getting the right process in place not only on the technical side but also from a management standpoint.”

**Jeremy Berecz** (CTO [Plezi][3]): “Insight, experience and goodwill are the qualities that makes Marc a major asset when he worked with us on improve our organisation and software development processes. This allowed us to focus on the major challenges of our startup’s growth.”

You can also read more on what I usually do as a coach on my [hire][4] page or take a look at what I write on my [blog][5].

## Details

I don't know if this experiment will have some success or not, so conditions are subject to change. Obviously if I get dozens of request I won't be able to fullfill them :)

In the meantime, here are a few details to keep in mind:

- I reserve the right to refuse if the project doesn't fit my "positive impact" criteria. 
- The positive impact needs to be at the center of your project.
- I'm in France, so ideally we need to be in a compatible timezone.
- We'll first have a quick call to figure out if I can indeed help out. I'll tell you then if I feel like I won't be relevant to your particular problem.
- I'll only commit to a limited amount of consulting hours, to be determined between us during the first call.
- If there is a lot of demand, I might refuse some calls just because of a lack of time.
- I can speak both French (native) & English.

## Getting in touch

You can contact me via email: marcg.gauthier -at- gmail -dot- com with a quick introduction of your project & topic you'd like to discuss. I'll get back to you as soon as I can given my schedule.
