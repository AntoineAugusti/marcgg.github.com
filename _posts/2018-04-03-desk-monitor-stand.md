I've bought a new desk as well as a new monitor, so I've decided to improve my setup. The desk is a simple [Ikea Hilver table][1],  but I built the monitor stand. Since I wanted to keep track of what I did, I took some pictures and I figured I could share them here... to be honest I'm not a good handyman, so I'm not sure if it'll be useful to anyone but here you go!

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><a href="/assets/blog/desk/main_hd.jpg"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/main_ld.jpg" alt="Home desk with a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 700px;"/></a></div>

Note that it is heavily inspired by [Jeff Sheldon][2]'s stand, but I didn't use raw wood because I felt a simple melamine white panel would look better with the bamboo desk. I also didn't want to use the [Capita legs][3] because they would make my monitor way too high and hurt my neck in the long run, so instead I built custom legs.

_Disclaimer: This article was a nightmare to write in english, I couldn't find proper translations for woodworking terms I only knew in French like "tasseaux", "double filetage", "chant thermocolant", "niveau"... so don't hesitate to correct me in the comments!_

## The Material

- Melamine white panel 80cm x 25cm, 6.95€
- Leftover pine wood approx. 2m, 2€
- Double threaded bolts, 2.79€
- Thermobonding decorative film, 5.40€

## How To Build It

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/1n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

I bought really simple leftover piece of pine already cut like this.  In order to build the legs I just had to cut it into 4 pieces of 5cm each - instead of 10cm for the smaller legs I found out at retailers.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/2n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Be careful when measuring! The sad thing is that I only have this really old school saw that destroys everything in its path. It did the job, but I was happy to have a bit more wood than I actually needed.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/3n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

The raw four legs.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/4n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Since the saw did quite a number on the wood, some sanding was needed to smooth everything out. If the leg was too damaged but still working I saved it for the less visible back of the monitor stand.

Testing if everything is level... success!

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/6n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Now drilling into the legs.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/7n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Then to add the double thread bolt.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/8n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

There might be a better way to do it, but I used pliers to screw it to the legs.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/9n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

There are some minor imperfections, but that's fine since they are mostly going to be underneath the panel.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/10n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Now to measure where to add the legs. I decided to offset them a lot from the edge of the panel. This in addition to their color really close to the bamboo should make them barely visible.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/11n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Protip: use a piece of tape to know exactly how far to drill!

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/12n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Screwing the legs, then testing the level again.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/12bn.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Since it's a white panel, I wanted to use decorative film on the sides to hide the wood. The one I found was thermobonding, so I had to use an iron. To avoid damaging it, I put a piece of paper between the iron and the film.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/13n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Then to remove the extra material with a cutter.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/14n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

If it's not very precise, it doesn't feel correct.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/desk/15n.jpg" alt="Building a custom monitor stand" style="padding: 0px; width: 650px;"/></div>

Looking good!

Underneath the monitor stand I can hide a [USB hub][4] where I plug the mouse and keyboard so I don't have too many wires going around, but I'll probably get a wireless mouse and keyboard soon. On top of it I store a few things, including my [bluetooth speaker][5]. I didn't invest into bigger speakers because I mostly use [my tacky gaming headset][6]. My monitor is [a simple 24'' HP][7] and on the side you can see my [2012 Macbook Pro][8] that's still holding up very well.
