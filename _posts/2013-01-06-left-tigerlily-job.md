---

I joined [Tigerlily][1] even before it was called that and, for 3 years, I contributed to the creation of [amazing products][2] that are now used by major companies in France and abroad. We built a great team of very talented people, brought innovation to how brands would interact with their users on social networks and always thrived to be the best at what we’d put our minds into.

It was a great experience in which I learned a lot and enjoyed the [startup atmosphere][3]. I became really invested in the project and became the lead developer, but now I feel that it is time for another adventure.

There are a few personal reasons that made me decide to leave. The main one is the opportunity that was given to me by [Drivy][4] ([formerly known as VoitureLib][5]), the startup I’m going to join.

This company is centered around a product that can be roughly summarized by « It’s like [AirBnB][6], but for cars ». The idea of [collaborative consumption][7] always attracted me because I think this is what will make a difference in the long run. Instead of buying products we barely need, why not collaborate? Picture a city where you can get a car, quickly, for cheap and without having to go through the hassle of the main renting companies. That'd be pretty cool!

On the technical side, yes, I'll still be working with [Ruby On Rails][8]. Of course changing job will put me in front of new problems to solve or ones I haven’t tackled in years, so it's going to be interesting!

Don’t get me wrong, I still think that what Tigerlily is doing is cool and that the team is amazing. I simply feel like I’ve done everything I needed to do there and that I must seek something different. It’s very hard to leave the people and not be able to contribute to the progress the company will make, but there are times when you have to look for something else.

Life, heh.

I wish the best to the Tigerlily team, and now I’m looking forward to my first day tomorrow!
