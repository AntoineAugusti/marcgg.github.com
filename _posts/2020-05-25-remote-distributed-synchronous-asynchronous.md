A lot of people tend to mix people working remotely and people working asynchronously. While it's often the case that people not co-located in a single office will prefer asychronous communication, that's not a given. I've seen people all working in an open space still favoring Slack over shoulder tapping, and  people working at home reaching for their phone every time something needs to be discussed.

This is especially visible with companies forced into remote work, as a lot of them simply converted their physical meetings to conference calls. This will usually spell disaster, as they will lose a lot of productivity, leading to more meetings, and a general feeling that remote doesn't work for them.

## Remote Work

I try to avoid saying things like "truly remote", and instead order remote friendlyness of organisations on a scale that goes like this:

0. **Co-located team**: There is an office and all employees need to work from there.
1. **Team allowing remote work**: There is an office and all employees usually work there. However they can also work from home sometimes.
2. **Remote-friendly team**: There is an office, but not everyone need to work there.
3. **Mostly distributed team**: There is an office, but only a small percentage of the company works there.
3. **Fully distributed team**: There is no physical office and people do not work in the same location.

You can also add the fact that some company have multiple office. Each office can have a diffent approach to remote, but usually people can move between offices.

## Synchronous vs Asynchrounous

First let's define quickly what the two approaches are. Of course, it's not one or the other, but a scale.

- **A synchronous team** will use meetings and brainstorms to move projects forward. The team will favor personnal interactions directly either in person, over the phone or via video conference. The organisation is fine with paying the overheads in time spent & lost of focus because of the increased productivity of collaborative synchronous work.

- **An asynchronous team** will prefer emails, chat and documentation over meetings and calls. The team usually values long period of uninterupted time, and deems this more productive than the alternative.

A team is co-located or fully remote doesn't mean it will be working in a way or another. This is why some companies can be fully remote but require their employee to be within a certain time zone, or at least be fully available in the usual working hours of a time zone.

On the other hand, co-located companies can prefer individual offices, or quiet hours in open spaces. They can also track and reduce the number of meetings to a minimum in order to maximize time focused on tasks.

## Conclusion

Each approach can and has worked depending on the type and scale of the company. For instance a brand new startup could benefit from their founders brainstorming synchronously in the in an office for a few months to kickstart their project. On the other hand, a larger company can leverage remote work to hire in other cities and reach new talents. Finally a company with complex software engineering work can benefit from a mostly asynchronous culture in order to maximize focus and leave developers in a flow state.

To add my two cents, I don't think a company that is co-located and synchronous is the way to go anymore. Everyone should allow some remote work at the very least, and prefer asychronous communication when possible. Founders should take this into consideration when starting their projects, and existing companies should evolve their process - even after the COVID crisis.
