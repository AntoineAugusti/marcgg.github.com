I've always liked [Oren Ellenbogen][1]'s idea of having a [Manager README][2] or something close to what [Michael Lopp has on his site][3]. After some time I finally wrote mine and shared it internally, and after even more time I've decided to share it publicly, so if you're interested you can [go and check it out now][4].

If you're wondering what this it, why I think it's useful and how I wrote mine, keep reading.

## What Is a Manager README?

It's a document that a manager would give to their direct report, explaining the way they operate at work. The content of document is free form, but often showcases what the manager values, what their expectations are going to be or how they prefer to communicate. 

Regarding the format, it does not feel very important, I've seen everything ranging from [slides][5] to [Google Docs][6] or [dedicated websites][7].

Finally I think that any good manager README needs to be a living document. I'm sure that mine won't look the same in a few years, so it's important to keep it up to date.

## Why Write One?

This document is supposed to help with a few things, including a faster onboarding or a public visibility over your management style. Personally I decided to go through the exercise of writing one for a few reasons.

Firstly, **I prefer explicit communication over implicit communication**. If I'm your manager, I know that I will have a significant impact on your life at work and your ability to succeed professionally for a while. Because of this, I don't want my personality quirks to get in the way, so if we are going to work together for a while, I'd much rather show you right away how I usually do things. This way you'll know where I stand, and we can easily debate on what we disagree on. This also saves you time and mental load to not have to guess what I'm thinking.

Secondly, **the exercise is really interesting**. Spending a few hours writing this document forces you to really think about how you work. This is a great moment to review the way you do things. It's easy to say: "I value work/life balance", but do you really? Do you have examples where you've showcased this?

On top of this, once the document is shared, it **makes you accountable** to what you wrote. The README is the way I intend to operate but, being human and all, I will most likely deviate and make various mistakes. This is why mine starts by:

> If you see a discrepancy between this document and my behaviour, please tell me.

Finally I think that having this document public should **help future people working in my team or future employers know what kind of manager I am**. This way if there is a deep disagreement, we can both avoid months of painful times that usually conclude by someone leaving the company.

## How I Wrote Mine

First I decided to make something that applies a lot to my current job, but can still be read and make sense to someone outside of my company. Some parts like the work from home policy and certain tools are specific, but I think it still gives the general intent.

Then I tried to strike a balance of theoretical ideas, like the qualities I value, and really practical things such as the best way to reach me depending on the context.

Once I was done with the first draft, I sent it to a few people who worked with me for a while to get their opinion, and changed a couple of things based on their feedback.

Finally I shared it with my direct reports and some other managers that were curious. Now I'm only updating the content every couple of months depending on what I've learned and how my view on things evolve.
