_tl;dr: I had to run specs on a lot of different projects and gather results. Here's how I did it with shell scripts and Ruby._

For a couple of years now I've been teaching a Ruby on Rails class for approximatively 100 students. Since I believe in learning by doing, I try to get them to actually write code as much as possible. To do this I usually give them automated tests that they have to get to pass. I'm not a huge believer in grades, but I do have to give them one and it's always a good incentive for the students to get to work. Therefore all these exercices go this way: 20 tests, 1 point per test passing.

Every week, I would give them a new exercice and I try to get it corrected before the next class. I would then adapt my slides according to their results to focus on pain points. It also allows me to spot students in difficulty. Overall I think it's a good approach and it gets everyone coding on the first day of class.

The problem with this is that every week I would end up with close to a hundred Ruby on Rails projects on which I would need to run the specs to see how my students performed. Doing this manually would take forever, especially if I wanted insights like "how many students failed the 5th test?", so obviously I had to automate this.

## Without Rails

Running RSpec on a simple Ruby project without Rails is easier because loading a few Ruby files is pretty straightforward and rspec comes with tooling for this situation.

### Using a Formatter

First we need to use a [JSON formatter][1] so that rspec's output becomes easily usable:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'rspec'
require 'rspec/core/formatters/json_formatter'

config = RSpec.configuration
formatter = RSpec::Core::Formatters::JsonFormatter.new(config.output_stream)
reporter =  RSpec::Core::Reporter.new(config)
config.instance_variable_set(:@reporter, reporter)
loader = config.send(:formatter_loader)
notifications = loader.send(:notifications_for, RSpec::Core::Formatters::JsonFormatter)
reporter.register_listener(formatter, *notifications)
{% endhighlight %}

### Running The Specs

Once the formatter is setup, we need to iterate over every projects with `Dir.entries` and load the implementation files for every project:

{% highlight ruby %}
Dir["code_path/*.rb"].each {|file| require file }
{% endhighlight %}

... and actually run the specs right after:

{% highlight ruby %}
RSpec::Core::Runner.run([file])
{% endhighlight %}

The problem here is that we don't unload the previously loaded files, which can lead to issues. To fix this, the simplest solution is to run this in [a new process][2] and the memory encapsulation will take care of itself:

{% highlight ruby %}
fork do
 Dir["code_path/*.rb"].each { |file| require file }
 RSpec::Core::Runner.run([file])
end
{% endhighlight %}


### Reading the Results
Once the specs are done running, you can just access the results via the formatter with `formatter.output_hash`. For instance if you want the number of failures:

{% highlight ruby %}
formatter.output_hash[:summary][:failure_count]
{% endhighlight %}

Once you managed to read the information you need, you can store it in a file somewhere and manipulate it easily in another process.

## With Rails

Getting a project ready to run rspec can get tricky as a lot of new factors are introduced (gems, databases...). Loading rails to run rspec is more complex than just looping throught the project's files and doing a `require`. I tried doing it by manually loading Rails from a fork like before, but it turned out to be a mess and there was some cases where it would simply not work. Remember, I have to work with hundreds of different student projects, and it has to run for all of them.

### Shell Scripts To The Rescue!

After a few hours stuck on weird Rails issues, I figured it would be simpler and faster to just introduce bash and brute force my problem. Since it's script issue, why not write shell scripts?

First I created a Ruby script that would generate a shell script for each project looking like this:

	cd FULL_PATH
	bundle install
	rake db:drop RAILS_ENV=test
	rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test
	rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
	bundle exec rspec spec > ../rspec_results.log

Running this script would setup the environment and run the specs while outputting the results in a log file that I will be able to process later on.

I don't think that sharing this piece of code is as interesting since it's a bit messy and depends on your file structure. The idea is to create a new `.sh` file for each project and don't forget to set it to the appropriate access rights:

{% highlight ruby %}
FileUtils.chown("youruser", "staff", path)
FileUtils.chmod(0777, path)
{% endhighlight %}

If you really want to take a look at what I've done here, [I created a gist][3]. Also note that you could have done the same thing with a bigger and more complex shell script, but I figured it would be simpler to it this way with a bunch of really small and independent files.

### Running The Scripts

Once all the scripts are created, we just need to run them. So, for every project folder run:

{% highlight ruby %}
Dir.entries($path).each do |entry|
  fork { exec("#{$path}/#{entry}/run.sh") }
end
{% endhighlight %}

Note that I run once again the code in a new process. This is mainly because I want to take advantage of the multiple cores on my machine. Of course this will result in my computer to really slow down, as running a hundred rails processes and bundler installation is very memory heavy, but from my experience it always turns out to be faster - at least on my computer. Using `exec` is nice here as it [completely replace the ruby process by the shell script][4].

### Reading The Results

Once all the scripts are done running, you can just parse the multiple `rspec_results.log` files you ended up with. In my experience it involves a few regular expressions but it's quite easy. You could also make the rspec output [more to your taste][5] with the `--format` option if you'd like.
