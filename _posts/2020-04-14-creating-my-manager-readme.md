I've always liked [Oren Ellenbogen][1]'s idea of having a [Manager README][2] or a document similar to what [Michael Lopp displays on his site][3]. After some time I finally wrote something and shared it internally, and I've now decided to share it publicly. 

If you're wondering what this is all about, why I think it's useful and how I wrote mine, keep reading. If you just want to read the document itself, you can [go and check it out now][4].

## What Is a Manager README?

It's a document that a manager can give to their direct report to help kickstart the work relationship. This is in no way a replacement for actually learning about the other person, or a way to avoid discussions. It's just a way to speed things up and make them more intentional.

The content itself is free form, but often showcases what the manager values, what their expectations are going to be or how they prefer to communicate.  Regarding the format, it does not feel very important to me. I've seen everything ranging from [slides][5] to [Google Docs][6] or [dedicated websites][7].

Finally I think that any good manager README needs to be a living document. I'm sure that mine won't look the same in a few years, so it's important to keep it up to date and have it challenged by the people reading it.

## Why Write One?

This document is supposed to help with a few things, including a faster onboarding and a public visibility over your management style. Personally I decided to actually write one for a few reasons.

Firstly, **I greatly prefer explicit communication over implicit communication**. If I'm your manager, I know that I will have a significant impact on your life at work and your ability to succeed professionally. Because of this, I don't want my personality quirks to get in your way, so if we are going to work together for a while, I'd much rather show you right away how I usually do things. You'll know quickly where I stand, and we can debate on what we disagree on. This will also save you the effort of guessing what I'm thinking or what I'm expecting from you.

Secondly, **the exercise itself is really interesting**. Spending a few hours writing this document forces you to really think about how you work. It is a great moment to challenge if your behaviour matches your values. It's easy to say: "I value work/life balance", but do you really? Do you have examples where you've showcased this?

On top of this, once the document is shared, it **makes you accountable** to what you wrote. The README is the way I intend to operate but, being human and all, I will most likely deviate and make various mistakes. This is why mine starts by:

> If you see a discrepancy between this document and my behaviour, please tell me.

Finally I think that having this document public should **help future people working in my team or future employers know what kind of manager I am**. This way, if there is a deep disagreement, we can both avoid painful months that usually conclude by someone interrupting the work relationship.

## How I Wrote Mine

First I decided to make something that applies a lot to my current job, but can still be read and make sense to someone outside of my company. Some parts like the work from home policy and certain tools are specific, but I think it still gives the general intent.

Then I tried to strike a balance between theoretical ideas, like the qualities I value, and really practical things such as the best way to reach me.

Once I was done with the first draft, I sent it to a few people who worked with me for a while to get their opinion, and changed a couple of things based on their feedback.

Finally I shared it with my direct reports and some other managers that were curious. Now I'm only updating the content every couple of months depending on what I've learned, the feedback I get and how my view on things evolve.
