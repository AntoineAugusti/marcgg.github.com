Every week I see people arguing over languages, frameworks, hosting
solutions, architectural patterns... and every week it's pointless.
I cringe when, interviewing candidates for a Rails developer position,
I hear something along the lines of "Hey, PHP is so bad, AMIRIGHT? \*nudge\*
\*nudge\*". So much energy wasted into this.

Because of that I felt like I should just write a post I can link people to when
they start talking about this, so here we go!

## A Mean To An End

The thing to understand is that languages and frameworks are just means
to an end. They are here to help us create software. If they accomplish
this, it's a success. Everything else is a question of context and preferences.

It'd be nice if there was a solution clearly superior to every other, with absolutely
no drawbacks whatsoever, but let's be pragmatic here. Some languages are
slower, have complex syntax, do not scale well, have a small community,
use a lot of memory... so in the end it's a mater of picking what would
work.

## Creating A New Product

Let's say I only knew PHP and MySQL and I wanted to create a very simple
website to test out an idea. No need for scalability, maintanability,
performances or even security. Just a simple prototype.

I would probably use PHP and MySQL and that would be fine, because here the decision
factor is speed and simplicity.At that point I want to build something .
This doesn't mean that using ElasticSearch wouldn't be cool or that MySQL is
superior. It's just a set of tools fitting my needs.

Fast forward and I got very good feedbacks on the prototype. Maybe then I'd want to
improve on what I already have by refactoring it using a PHP framework like Symfony. I
could also rewrite it using NodeJS if I expect a lot of concurency.
Maybe if I met a really good Go developer willing to help me on this
project I could use Go.

What I'm trying to say here is that there is no "NODEJS IS BETTER THAN PHP SO USE THIS,
YOU ARE THE WORST PERSON IF YOU USE THIS AND SHOULD BE ASHAMED".

If my project fails because I spent 2 months learning NodeJS, then NodeJS
was a bad choice. If my whole team is depressed because I enforced
using Rails instead of Django, then Rails was a bad choice.

## The Side Project

There is never a definitive answer to what technology one should use, just different situations.

If I start a [side project][1] to
learn cool new stuff, then it wouldn't make sense to use what I already know.
In this case my whole technical knowledge is a bad choice for this project.

This is simply because the goal here is different, so my choices need to
adapt.
