Learn about negotiating techniques from an old FBI kidnapping negotiator with years of experience. The book is filled with entertaining anecdotes from the field, concrete solutions to real life problems and theoretical concepts to go even further. For someone like me who didn't have any background in this topic, it was both pleasant to read and full of learnings.
